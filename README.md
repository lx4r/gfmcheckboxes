# GFMCheckboxes

> renders checkboxes in DokuWiki based on [GitHub Flavored Markdown's task lists](https://help.github.com/articles/about-task-lists/)

## Supported syntax

- `[ ]` renders an unchecked checkbox
- `[x]` or `[X]` renders a checked checkbox

## Usage

I recommend using this plugin together with [markdownku](https://www.dokuwiki.org/plugin:markdowku) to be able to make use all Markdown syntax.

### Recommended syntax for todo lists

```plain
- [ ] should do this
- [ ] should do that
- [x] already did this
- [X] already did that
```
